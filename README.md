## üåê Best Use of Velo by Wix

I have build a website using Velo by Wix. Wix Velo is a full-stack development platform that allows you to build a website from scratch, without any coding knowledge. It is a great tool for beginners who want to learn how to code, and for experienced developers who want to build a website quickly. Using Velo we can build a website in a matter of minutes, and we can also add custom JavaScript code to the website to make it more interactive. And we are using the following features of Wix

- **Wix Code**: For adding the backend functionality
- **Wix Data**: For storing the data
- **Wix Forms**: For creating the forms
- **Wix Stores**: For creating the store
- **Wix SEO**: For adding the SEO functionality
- **Wix Users**: For adding the user functionality
- **Wix Media**: For adding the media functionality
- **Wix Payments**: For adding the payment functionality
- **Wix Analytics**: For adding the analytics functionality
